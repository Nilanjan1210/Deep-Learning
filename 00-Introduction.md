## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of **machine learning** that focuses on training algorithms called **artificial neural networks**, which are designed to mimic how the human brain works when processing information.

## What is ANN?

**Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the biological brain.

- It is made up of layers of nodes (**neurons**).
- Each node takes inputs, applies a **weight** and **bias**, passes the result through an **activation function**, and sends it forward.
- ANNs are the foundation of deep learning when stacked into many layers.

## Popular Architectures

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)** – basic deep learning models.  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – for images and computer vision.  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **LSTMs**, **GRUs** – for sequential data like
